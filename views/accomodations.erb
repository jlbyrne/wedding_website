			<h1>Where to Stay</h1>
		</div>
		<p>Here are some recommendations for staying in the Charleston!</p>

			<h3><a href="http://www.homeaway.com/search/south-carolina/charleston/region:6374/arrival:2014-10-17/departure:2014-10-19/minSleeps/2">Homeaway.com</a></h3>
			<p>Homeaway is similar to AirBnB, and has lots of great options for the Charleston area. (It also features a much nicer logo than AirBnB.) It's typically less expensive to rent a small condo than it is to get a hotel room in the city, and most listings have room for at least 4 people.  This easily the best way to stay somewhere nice on a budget!</p>

			<p>Yes, it's a Days Inn, but pretty much everything in downtown Charleston is nicer than you think it is.  If you're not comfortable with Homeaway and are on a budget, this is the spot for you.  You also can't beat the location!</p>

		<h3>Other tips and tricks:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>There's an area west of the Ashley River that is technically part of Charleston, but is outside the city.  Make sure you check out your hotel's location on a map.</li>
			<li>If you do want to stay outside the city, Mount Pleasant is a great area.  It's spread out enough that you'll need a car to get around, but it has great shopping, bars and restaurants.</li>
